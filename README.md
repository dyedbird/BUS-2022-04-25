By: Burak Basogul

Abstract
The potential client(s) for this case are Government Disaster Management and / or Housing Agencies. The aim of the analysis is to provide the Agency Directors with targeted haven locations with readily available rental properties in low-risk climate change impact counties with optimum employment opportunities where most populations are at or below US median age.
Design
Targeted counties are in 13 states whose Climate Change Risk Index (CCRI) values are within 25 percentile of the lower 48 states’ Index values. Thereafter, from those counties which possess at least 6% Rental Vacancy Rate are selected for final analysis. Features included are Rental Vacancy, Median Household Size, Median Rental Cost, Population, Median Age, Median Earnings, Unemployment Rate and CCRI value. Each feature is percent ranked across all data and then each row of scores is averaged to determine a Desirability score for that particular county.
